		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<div class="faq-question">1) How do we get started?</div>
		<div class="faq-answer">Please contact me at <a href="mailto:leslie@scriptaedit.com" target="_blank">leslie@scriptaedit.com</a> to get started or if you have any questions. I&rsquo;d love to discuss your project and how we can work together.</div>
		<div class="faq-question">2) How much does your service cost?</div>
		<div class="faq-answer">Each project is unique. The fee will be based on the length of your document, the level of copyediting needed, the complexity of the writing, and your deadline. Once I see your document, I can provide a quote. I bill by the project, not by the hour, so you&rsquo;ll know the cost upfront and there will be no surprises.</div>
		<div class="faq-question">3) How does the process work?</div>
		<div class="faq-answer">We will communicate throughout the process to make your project successful. Your document and any information you share with me will be kept strictly confidential. The basic steps are as follows.
			<ol>
				<li>Email me your project description, document, timeline, and any other relevant information.</li>
				<li>I respond with a quote, generally within one business day. I&rsquo;m happy to provide a free sample edit on a small part of your document if requested.</li>
				<li>If you decide to proceed, I send a contract proposal with the scope of work, the schedule, and the fee. As necessary, we work out the details together.</li>
				<li>Once the contract is signed, you send the deposit. I edit per our agreed-on schedule.</li>
				<li>When the edit is complete, I send you the document with all edits visible in Track Changes (a feature of Microsoft Word). You review the edits and get back to me with your thoughts. </li>
				<li>Based on your feedback, I finalize the edits. Then I send the final document, and you make the final payment.</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="faq-question">4) Can you guarantee an error-free document?</div>
		<div class="faq-answer">Because I am human, I cannot guarantee an error-free document, but I will do my best to achieve that. I will strive to make your writing correct, clear, concise, and consistent.</div>
		<div class="faq-question">5) What file formats are accepted?</div>
		<div class="faq-answer">I accept Microsoft Word and use the Track Changes feature so that you&rsquo;ll be able to see all of my edits. I also accept Microsoft PowerPoint and HTML, but please note that the Track Changes feature is not available in these file formats.</div>
		<div class="faq-question">6) What types of payment are accepted?</div>
		<div class="faq-answer">I accept payment via PayPal, so you can pay with a credit card or bank account.</div>
